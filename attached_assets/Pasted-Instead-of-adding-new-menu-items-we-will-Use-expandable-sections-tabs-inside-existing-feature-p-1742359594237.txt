Instead of adding new menu items, we will:

Use expandable sections & tabs inside existing feature pages.
Leverage contextual navigation, ensuring users access new features when they need them.
Keep the discipline-based filtering consistent across all pages.
🛠 Recommended Integration for Missing Sections
Below is how each missing section can be incorporated without adding extra menu clutter:

1️⃣ Match Page (Live & Past Matches) → Integrate into Tournaments
🔹 Where to Add:

Inside Tournaments Page, introduce a new "Live Matches" Tab.
Inside each Tournament Details Page, add a "Match Analysis" sub-section.
🔹 UX Improvement:
✅ Users don’t need to go to a separate page to find live/past matches—just click on Tournaments > Live Matches.
✅ AI-powered match tracking & analysis will be accessible within each ongoing/past tournament.

🔹 Implementation Example:

Tabs inside Tournaments:
📅 Ongoing (Live Matches)
🏆 Upcoming
📜 Past Tournaments (Match History & Replays)
📊 Match Analysis (AI Breakdown)
2️⃣ Venues & Clubs Directory → Integrate into Community & Tournaments
🔹 Where to Add:

Under Community, add a "Clubs & Venues" Section.
Inside Tournaments, allow tournament organizers to list their venue.
🔹 UX Improvement:
✅ Players can find clubs easily without a new menu item.
✅ Tournaments can display their venue details for easy location access.

🔹 Implementation Example:

Inside Community:
📍 Find a Club
⭐ Club Ratings & Reviews
🔄 Memberships & Benefits
Inside Tournaments:
📍 Tournament Venue (With Directions & Booking)
3️⃣ Sponsorship & Monetization → Integrate into Leaderboards & Profile
🔹 Where to Add:

Under Leaderboards, add a "Sponsorships" tab.
Under Profile Settings, add a section for "Apply for Sponsorship."
Inside Community, add Crowdfunding & Player Support.
🔹 UX Improvement:
✅ Players can apply for sponsorship directly from their profile page.
✅ Fans & brands can support players through the Community hub.

🔹 Implementation Example:

Inside Leaderboards:
💰 Sponsored Players (List)
📢 Available Sponsorships (For Players to Apply)
Inside Profile:
🎯 Apply for Sponsorship
🏆 View Active Sponsorships
Inside Community:
🔹 Fan Donations & Crowdfunding for Upcoming Talents
4️⃣ Support & Help Center → Integrate into Profile & Floating Button
🔹 Where to Add:

Add a floating "Help" button on all pages.
Under Profile Settings, add a Support Center Tab.
🔹 UX Improvement:
✅ Users don’t need to search for help; the floating button makes it always accessible.
✅ The Profile Settings area keeps support requests organized.

🔹 Implementation Example:

🆘 Floating Button on All Pages:
💬 Live Chat
📜 FAQs & Knowledge Base
📩 Submit a Ticket
Inside Profile Settings:
🎯 Help Center
🆘 Contact Support
📑 FAQ Documentation
5️⃣ Multi-Discipline Expansion → Ensure Cross-Page Filtering
🔹 Where to Improve:

The Discipline Selector should filter tournaments, leaderboards, and training pages dynamically.
Users should not need to reselect their discipline every time they navigate.
🔹 UX Improvement:
✅ If a player chooses "American Pool," all pages automatically show only American Pool content.
✅ Their selection is remembered, avoiding unnecessary re-selections.

🔹 Implementation Example:

Make Discipline Selector Sticky Across Pages
Auto-Filter Content Based on Selection
Tournaments: Only shows discipline-specific tournaments.
Training: Personalized training for the selected discipline.
Leaderboards: Only shows relevant players.
Store: Equipment tailored to the selected discipline
